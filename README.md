 Building onto the existing Festo MPS production line at UBC Okanagan (UBCO) we created
 a dual-robot packaging system that packages the small workpieces. The system we developed
 utilizes two Kinova Gen3Lite robots that can pipeline the packaging as each robot passes the
 previous task onwards. One robot takes one smaller flatpack cardboard box out of the
 dispenser and then proceeds to fold the bottom using a complex set of linear and rotational
 movements. The packaging works under ideal conditions as our solution is hard-coded
 making everything must be in place otherwise the system fails.
